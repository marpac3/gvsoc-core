"""
Python generator for the IoV2BeatToSingleReqAdapter component.

Auto-inserted by the gvrun2 systree binding pass when a master port declares
signature ``IoV2Beat`` and the bound slave port declares signature
``IoV2SingleReq`` (see ``IoV2Beat.bridge_to`` in ``gvsoc/signature.py``). A
single-req slave answers each request with a single-beat response — inline
``IO_REQ_DONE``, async ``IO_REQ_GRANTED`` + one ``resp()``, or ``IO_REQ_DENIED``
+ ``retry()`` — but never a multi-beat stream. The adapter splits a read burst
into beat-sized sub-reads (issued one per cycle), forwards writes as-is, and
normalises the single-beat responses into the upstream per-beat ``resp()``
stream. It is a per-combination specialisation of ``IoV2BeatAdapter`` (same
machinery, with the single-beat-response contract checked in asserts builds).
